# encrypt

## convertfolder.py
Place this file in the folder you want to encrypt and all files inside that folder will be encrypted when you run the script. No harm done. Ignores symlinks by the way.

## encdec.py
More traditional single file or folder encryption program. State the location of the item you want to enceypt/decrypt and it will be done.

### IMPORTANT
Works with linux only right now.
